My first Basic c project, A Number Guessing Game 
<br>
Rules - 
1. generates a random number and asks the player to guess
2. if player's guess is higher than the actual number the program displays lower number please
3. similarly if the user's case is too low program prints higher number please
4. when the user guesses the correct number the program is the number of cases the player used to arrive at the number
